# Spelling-Test
Terminal spelling test program created in Python 3.6 for my children's 
spelling practice.

The program reads in the spelling test words from the selected .txt 
file. The .txt files must be located in the same directory as the program.

The program uses gtts to convert the text words into speech .

Required modules:
gtts
playsound
